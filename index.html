                <p class="role-info">The role of the tank in Overwatch is simple. Each team has a single tank and their job is to stay 
                    at the very front of their team and leverage their high health and powerful attacks to dominate the enemy team. 
                    Due to the tank's vital importance, their actions can ulimately sway the outcome of a match</p>
